Statement: We have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.

VM Name: Group 6 VM
VM Location: CS 4500 (Operating Systems) > skettner > Group 6 VM

User: root
Pass: CS_4500_001

How to access files: In the Home directory (~), do: cd CS-4500 and all the files will be there. 
The binary exe list_test.exe is in there with the makefile and everything else.

How to run: Go into the CS-4500 folder (as described above) and type make. You should only have to do that since it’s called makefile. 
If you want to run it then do ./list_test

Assignment Parts: Our assignment consists of a few main pieces. We have the list.c file for the functions, the list.h for the function definitions and then we have list_test.c for testing to show that the functions work properly. 
In addition to the functional code, we have a makefile to compile the code and an exe which is created (with .o files) for running the program. 

Challenges: Challenges we overcame were mostly from the Linux portion. Creating and running a makefile was a big challenge that we overcame. 
For some reason it initially compiled into a .exe file not sure why and not sure how we fixed it.
Also, getting the code onto the UCCS server’s VM was a struggle because we had issues with FTP from our local machines and getting files on the VM wasn’t very easy. 

How we solved the problems: We solved these problems by doing research, using our prior knowledge and consulting each other and working towards achieving goals with issues blocking our path. 
We learned how to get files and data on the VM and learned how to properly run a makefile that compiles all our c and header files. 

Most of our discussions were held person to person and we didn’t have any notes since we worked on a lot of this project together. 
We did end up using online resources for support for Github and other C topics.
